First project for my Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree - Comparing Local to Global Trends in Average Temperature

## Purpose Statement
In this project, I will analyze local and global temperature data and compare the temperature trends my local city (Columbus, OH) to the overall global temperature trends. I will seek to answer the following questions: 

  - How does the temperature in Columbus compare to the global average, and has this trend been consistent over time?  
  - How have changes in Columbus's temperatures over timem compared to changes in the global average?  
  - What does the overall temperature trend look like? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
  - Are the temperature averages generally correlated, and what does that relationship look like?
